<b>Company/Organisation</b>: Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore <br><br>

<b>Title: Senior Engineer (Oct 2019 - March 2022)</b>
<ul>
<li>Developed Neural Network based GPF (Gasoline Particulate Filter) models and Physics-based TWC (Three-
way Catalytic Converter) models and deployed them to a HiL (Hardware-in-Loop) simulation environment.
The sensor models increased the test portfolio by 5%.<li>
</li>Headed the setting up of the first Electric Vehicle HiL (Hardware-in-Loop) environment for powertrain
systems in India. The team consisted of 4 developers. It enabled digital validation of electric cars in India.<li>
</li>Headed the simulation model quality improvement topic. Improved model validation tool, prepared a timeline
and tracked progress of the topic with a total of 8 model developers. Model quality was improved by more
than 10% on average.<li>
</li>Developed Neural Network based sensor models of turbochargers to eliminate critical errors from lambda
sensors of simulation platforms and deployed in Hardware-in-Loop simulators. Removing errors in the
lambda sensor enabled many diagnostic tests. The Neural Network based model was deployed to production
and used by stakeholders.</li>
</ul>

<b>Title: Engineer (Jul 2017 - Sep 2019)</b>
<ul>
<li>Optimised physics-based Gasoline engine simulation models and added extra features to them to increase the
portfolio of test cases. Used different global optimisation algorithms to parameterise the simulation models.
Simulation models were delivered in every V-Cycle to enable digital validation of automotive software.</li>
<li>Worked on-site (Germany) for three months as a coordinator and commissioned Gasoline and Diesel
powertrain simulation model variants.</li>
</ul>
    
<b>Title: PGET (Jul 2016 - Jun 2017)</b>
<ul><li>Developed proof of concept of the Gasoline engine’s torque controller using MATLAB, Simulink, Stateflow
and generated C code. The controller was delivered to the ESP HiL (Hardware-in-Loop) simulation engineers
of another department. This project successfully enabled digital validation of software and generated business
impact.</li></ul>
